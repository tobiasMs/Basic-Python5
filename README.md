# Basic-Python5
Last chapter for basic python

# Use Case
## Objective Statement :
* Get the insight about Function in Python
* Get the insight abous Class, Object, and Static method.
* Get the insight about txt file in Python
* To gain new knowledge about Pydoc
* To gain new knowledge about io
* Get the insight about class, object, and method in the Python
* Get the new insight about built-in module in Python

## Challenges :
* Python is a case sensitive programming language, so the writing of the syntax must be considered
* A lot of new things about python will be learned here, so it needs a detailed and easy to understand explanation

## Expected Outcome :
* Knowing how to define, call, and return Function in Python
* Understand about argumen and parameter in the Python Function
* Knowing the different between class and static method.
* Knowing how to open, read, close, and delete the txt files in the Python
* Knowing more about pydoc and io
* Knowing the aplication of os path and unit test
* Understanding class, object, and method in Python
* Knowing more about built-in module, math, datetime, random, sys, and os, in the Python

## Benefits :
* As a basic material for learning Python language for beginners
* As additional knowledge about function, txt file, pydoc, io, os path, unit test, python - class, object, and method, and built-in module in python

# Outlines
## Function - Definition, Call, and Return
* Function in python can organize codes and have 1 specific role and can be re-use.
* Return and not return function in python (re-use or single use).
* Handle value results and return results in function.
* Local and global variable in function when pass by reference (referencing data changed inside or outside function).
## Function - Argument and Parameter
* The keyword argument function to naming of parameter with explicitly mentioned.
* The positional argument function to use for iterable variable.
* Parameter function order to see the order of the function.
* Anonymous function to get to know about lambda function.
## Pydoc
* The pydoc module automatically generates documentation from Python modules.
* The pydoc module comes packaged along with Python.
* Open, Read, Close, and Delete Txt File
* The open() function has many parameters but be focusing on the first two
* Read text from the text file using the file read(), readline(), or readlines() method of the file object.
* The close() method used to close the file that is no longer in use.
* os.remove() method in Python is used to remove or delete a file.
## io
* Python io module allows us to manage the file-related input and output operations.
* This module is quite useful to perform file-related I/O operations.
## os path
* os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
* os.path module is sub module of OS module in Python used for common path name manipulation.
## Unit test
* The unittest module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests.
* The unittest unit testing framework was originally inspired by unit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages.
## Python - Class, Object, and Static Method
* Class, Object and Static Method is different each other but can have a similar results. 
## Python Math Module
* Python math module is a standard module in Python that used to deal with mathematical operations
* Math module provides the value of various constants and functions to deal with both basic operations
## Python Random Module
* Python Random module is a built-in module of Python which is used to generate random numbers
## Python Datetime Module
* The datetime module provides classes for manipulating dates and times
* The classes in datetime module provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals
## Python os Module
* The os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system
* One of the methods in os module is os.mkdir() to create a directory in the python
## Python sys Module
* The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment
* One of the functions in the sys module that is often used to handling exceptions is exc_info
